# Issue-Tracker

Our project will consist of developing a Bug Tracker. The program would allow users to submit any issue and the priority of the issue (whether low, medium, high). Then there would be an admin side to manage and resolve the issue. This would be similar to the system used by the ITS department of the university or any other help desk ticketing system. Since there is a time constraint, we will ensure to focus our time on developing primary features. These primary features might consist of:

### Admin
* The ability to assign tasks to a developer

### Developer
* The ability to override the priority of bug and give a reason if possible
* The ability to edit status of bug (submitted, pending, approved, resolved, close) with date and time stamp
* The ability to resolve or close bugs
* The ability to reopen bugs, if needed
* The ability to search and sort bugs by date, priority, user, etc.

### User
* The ability for the user to share description
* The ability to assign priority to bug
* The ability to categorize bugs in areas of concern (database, UI/UX, documentation, etc.)
* The ability to attach files/images

A more basic description of the web based application would be the ability to create a bug and close a bug. The programming languages that will be used are Java, Python, HTML and MySQL. If there is more time, we might decide to explore other features and languages, such as Javascript and CSS to improve the user experience and interface design. We will also continue to explore XAMPP if deemed necessary. The end product will, therefore, be a basic system with features vital to the operation of the application.
